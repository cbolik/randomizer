I wish I could tell you it gets better. But it doesn't get better. You get better.
Between stimulus and response there's a space, in that space lies our power to choose our response, in our response lies our growth and our freedom.
Our mind is a garden, our thoughts are the seeds, you can grow flowers, or you can grow weeds.
The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.
Rather than being your thoughts and emotions, be the awareness behind them.
Ships don't sink because of the water around them. They sink because of the water that gets in them.
The bad news is nothing lasts forever. The good news is nothing lasts forever.
In this moment, there is plenty of time. In this moment, you are precisely as you should be. In this moment, there is infinite possibility.
Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind. Always.
Rewrite a story that you've been telling about yourself that no longer serves you.
Say NO to something today as a way to honor your needs. Resist the need to justify, explain, or defend.
Recharge your batteries by taking a nap, or going to bed early or on time.
Reach out to someone that means a lot to you. Connecting with loved ones is good for your health.
Share your struggles with a trusted friend. Bottling up emotions can lead to feelings of isolation and overwhelm.
Let go of the need to be validated by others and instead practice validating and accepting yourself.
Reach out to someone who is having a hard time and offer support. Or, ask for help if you need it!
Step back and observe your thoughts. Recognize patterns and challenge your thoughts by asking - "is this true?"
Can you let it be okay?
I don‘t always get what I like, so I learned to like what I get.
I’m trying different things as much as I can – time is of the essence, man. (Paul Weller)
Courageous. Decisive. Friendly. Focused.
What you focus on grows, what you think about expands, and what you dwell upon determines your destiny.
When everything is moving and shifting, the only way to counteract chaos is stillness. When the surface is wavy, dive deeper for quieter waters.
